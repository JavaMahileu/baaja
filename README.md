## What is Baaja? 
Baaja is a JAMA community project with the main goal to try and master fresh technologies stack and architectural solutions (we will split it to microservices once it is ready). And the second goal is to get the interactive presentation tool that can be used to make our Tech Talks and Meet Up more fun and interactive.

## How to participate?
It is better to join some group but you can also pariticipate individually. Just go to Trello Board and assign any User Story to you. Develop it, pass code review, merge and enjoy your contribution.
